Disclaimer
----------

This project aims to deliver `Django CMS`_ very quickly. Without do anything else which is not already written
in this document, you can use all Django CMS features with just few configurations.
Obviously all these steps follow the `official documentation`_ (beta version) of Django CMS. Remember to read all main
documentation sections because this is **just** a template and there is **NO intention** to replace the official
documentation.
